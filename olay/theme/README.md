# Premade themes

Nothing too fancy, just meant to be a starting point for your own designs.  
You can copy and paste these themes into the CSS field of OBS' Browser-Source.  
Files are prefixed with the name of the module they were made for.
The themes only include overrides - see their *default* styles for a list of available selectors.  
You can preview themes by appending `&theme=<theme-filename-without-extension>` to the URL - e.g. `&theme=clock-simple`.  
More themes may be added in the future.
